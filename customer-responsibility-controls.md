# Using GitHub

These are the requirements to join our GitHub organization. None are optional.

## Creating an account 

If you haven't created a GitHub account yet, do so with your Federal email, which will assist with [records retention](http://ben.balter.com/open-source-for-government/#records).  

If you already have a GitHub account, simply add your Federal email to your existing account. Do not create a new account. You can also set up custom email routing through the [Notifications Center](https://github.com/settings/notifications).  

### Setting up account profile

#### [Activate 2-Factor Authentication](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication)

All team Federal are *required* to employ 2-factor for their GitHub access. While you're at it, it's a *very, very* good idea to do this for your [Gmail account](http://lifehacker.com/5932700/please-turn-on-two-factor-authentication/all) and [elsewhere](http://lifehacker.com/5938565/heres-everywhere-you-should-enable-two-factor-authentication-right-now/all). GitHub access _will not_ be provided if 2FA is turned off.

#### [Add your name to your account](https://github.com/18F/Using-GitHub/blob/master/best_practices.md#be-sure-your-account-has-your-name)


This makes it easier for your team to know whose account it is and to administer the teams, but most of all it helps a lot with autocomplete in a bunch of situations.  

Please make sure that you go to [your settings page](https://github.com/settings/profile) and make sure your name (First and Last) is filled in.  

#### [Add a profile avatar](https://github.com/18F/Using-GitHub/blob/master/best_practices.md#add-a-profile-picture)

This is a simple courtesy that makes team projects all the more social and fun.  It only takes a second but your teammates will appreciate it. We are not dogmatic that it be a headshot, but please make it a unique avatar.

It only takes a moment to go to [your settings page](https://github.com/settings/profile) and upload a picture.  

#### Make your membership public


Go to your organization's [team page](https://github.com/orgs/18F/people) and click (Make Public).  

### Teams

Even if you don't have write access into a repo, we strongly encourage the submission of pull requests for improvements or fixes.

Contractors or external collaborators should only be added to teams with scoped write permissions to the repos they're working on. They should never have Admin level rights. In order to separate out these permissions, create a team in the format of `projectname-admins` for staff. Please coordinate with DevOps in the Slack channel when on-boarding contractors or external collaborators.
