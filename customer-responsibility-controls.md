# Using GitHub

These are the requirements to join our GitHub organization. None are optional.

## Creating an account 

If you haven't created a GitHub account yet, do so with your government email, which will assist with [records retention](http://ben.balter.com/open-source-for-government/#records).  

If you already have a GitHub account, simply [add your goverment email to your existing account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/). Do not create a new account. You can also set up custom email routing through the [Notifications Center](https://github.com/settings/notifications). Make sure your commits are tied to your government email address.

### Setting up an account profile

#### [Activate 2-factor Authentication](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication)

Everyone is *required* to use 2-factor authentication (2FA) for their GitHub access. While you're at it, it's a *very, very* good idea to do this for your [email account](http://lifehacker.com/5932700/please-turn-on-two-factor-authentication/all) and [elsewhere](http://lifehacker.com/5938565/heres-everywhere-you-should-enable-two-factor-authentication-right-now/all). GitHub access _will not_ be provided if 2FA is turned off. Also be sure to [save your recovery codes](https://help.github.com/articles/downloading-your-two-factor-authentication-recovery-codes/) in case you lose access to 2FA.

#### [Add your information to your account](https://github.com/settings/profile)

This makes it easier for your team to know who you are, but most of all, it helps a lot with autocomplete!

A complete [public profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) includes:

- **Company:** Your government agency.
- **Location:** Your primary work location (City, State).
- **Email:** A [verified government email address](https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address/).

#### [Add a profile avatar](https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-set-up-my-profile-picture/)

This is a courtesy that makes team projects all the more social and fun.  It only takes a second but your teammates will _really_ appreciate it. We don't requirethat it be an actual headshot, but please make it a unique avatar.

It only takes a moment to go to [your settings page](https://github.com/settings/profile) and upload a picture.  

#### Make your membership public

Go to the organization's [team page](https://github.com/orgs/18F/people) and click **Make Public**.  

## Teams

Teams can give you [`administrative`, `write`, or `read` permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization-repository/). Even if you have `write` access into a repository, we _strongly_ encourage the submission of pull requests for improvements or fixes.

Contractors or external government collaborators should only be added to teams with scoped `write` permissions to the respositories they're working on. They should *never* have `adminsitrative` level rights. In order to separate out these permissions, create a team in the format of `projectname-admins` for government staff if necessary.
